Whoa look this finally works!
(I may or may not have tears in my eyes, Github and Jekyll have griefed me so hard all week)

Welcome to my website/blog/???

I'm going to try and use this space to keep track of the different things that I make/want to make, and to hopefully provide insight into what goes on behind the scenes with these projects. I also intend to write about random things and thoughts that capture my fancy, but knowing myself this page in its entirity will probably be left to die in all of 25 minutes after its creation, so I'm not going to hold myself to that.

I hope to see this space populated with all kinds of weird art, niche doodads, and solutions to problems nobody actually has.
Along with documentation of what it is I've done, I'll try and include relevant files and tutorial links where possible. I've found great help in others sharing their files and designs for free in the past, and I wish to continue this legacy to whatever extent I can.

One of the biggest reasons this exists is because of my desire to detach my art from any sense of quantitative metrics. I don't want to know how many people have viewed my posts, or liked them or whatever other nonsense. Yes, this in part me avoiding potential criticism, and probably ties in with my deep seated fear of rejection, but in the same vein, I also believe it frees me from the fear of making things "for attention", whatever that's supposed to mean. At the end of the day, I'll have made what I've made, and this site will hopefully have helped me keep track of it.
I imagine this would also help keep me from spamming people on instagram, as anyone on here would probably actually want to be on here (or so I'd hope atleast).

If you've stumbled upon this page and taken interest in anthing you've seen/need help with something that I've documented, feel free to reach out, I'm always happy to try and help.
