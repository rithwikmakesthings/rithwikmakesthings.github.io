      Icons on the Evolving Role of Mexican Cuisine in LA</a></div>
  <div class="notion-text">Together, critic Jonathan Gold, food scholar Evan
    Kleiman, and chefs Ray Garcia, Bricia Lopez, and Carlos Salgado have spent
    more than a lifetime preparing, eating, and writing about Latin American
    cuisine. Before their recent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
      class="notion-link"
      href="http://www.getty.edu/visit/cal/events/ev_2035.html">panel
      discussion</a> at the Getty, offered in conjunction with Pacific Standard
    Time, they sat down with us to reflect on the role of Mexican cuisine in the
    life of Los Angeles and how we might expand our taste buds to go deeper.
  </div>
  <div class="notion-text"><b>SS: As a chef (or critic), do you consider
      yourself an artist?</b></div>
  <div class="notion-text"><b>EK:</b> Art to me often has an intellectual
    component. I think of food preparation as a craft–I don’t think of it as
    art.</div>
  <div class="notion-text"><b>RG:</b> My personal approach to food is more of a
    craftsman. I like having my tools in hand, sort of creating and building,
    and my approach is much more trial and error. It’s part social scientist,
    and part repair person or builder. I put food out, and wait for the
    reaction, and see what we can push, what we can improve.</div>
  <div class="notion-text"><b>JG:</b> I’m a writer. Some people can call writers
    artists, some people cannot. In terms of food, there are people who approach
    cuisine from an art angle. Carlos Salgado is astonishing that way. His food
    is rooted in Mexican flavors, but there’s this level of abstraction in his
    food. Is it art as opposed to food? No, it’s food, but it’s being approached
    in a different way.</div>
  <div class="notion-text"><b>CS:</b> The highest point in my life is being with
    close family and friends, in the backyard over a fire, cooking over the
    course of many hours, sitting under the sky, and just filling this space
    with so much warmth. When I’m cooking there, I feel much more like an artist
    than when I worked in the highest-concept restaurants. They are like museums
    of food, accessible only with a certain level of literacy on the part of the
    diner, with a certain level of cultural experience and background.</div>
  <div class="notion-text"><b>JG:</b> El Salvadoreño cooking. It’s very basic,
    but the ways they use corn and greens and cheese. The fermentations are
    lovely.</div>
  <div class="notion-text"><b>EK:</b> I love Guatemalan tamales, maybe more than
    Mexican tamales. The masa is often mixed with potato, so it’s much more
    tender. They’re wrapped in banana leaves, so there’s a different flavor. And
    the way they are filled is different; often there’s olives or raisins or
    prunes in them.</div>
  <div class="notion-text"><b>BL:</b> I love Peruvian food. Everything from the
    ceviche to rice and beans, all of the flavors. It has so much depth.</div>
  <div class="notion-text"><b>CS:</b> Baja coastal cuisine. The freshness of
    it–you eat seafood in the morning because it just came in. Very simply
    prepared, very intense, briny ocean flavors: big clams, oysters, shrimp.
    Big, big flavors.</div>
  <div class="notion-text"><b>SS: If you could recommend one dish or element in
      Mexican-American cuisine that a total beginner must try, what would it
      be?</b></div>
  <div class="notion-text"><b>EK:</b> Tacos, because anything you eat with your
    hands is less intimidating than something that requires silverware. It takes
    you back to the permission of childhood, and that joy of just eating that is
    super direct. There is nothing in between you and the food.</div>
  <div class="notion-text"><b>BL:</b> I think mole is a really good one. A lot
    of people think of it as a chocolate sauce, and yes, it has chocolate, but
    it also has like 18 other things. I always recommend three things: mole, the
    barbacoa, and the chiles rellenos at my restaurant, just because I think
    they are universally delicious.</div>
  <div class="notion-text"><b>CS:</b> I would say try more and different types
    of chilies, and the salsas that result from them. The range of flavors, and
    balance of flavors, is really exciting, and is my favorite part of Mexican
    food.</div>
  <div class="notion-text"><b>RG:</b> Put aside your thoughts and limitations on
    what Mexican food can be, and how much it can cost. Especially in LA, there
    is almost a cult-like following for cheap Mexican food, for the greasy taco
    truck. There is something people find exciting about that, but I think it’s
    good to stop and wonder why your taco costs a dollar. There must be a lot
    behind it that allows you to eat a dollar taco. It probably doesn’t include
    a living wage, a safe work environment, or the best quality ingredients for
    you and your body. We could understand where our food is coming from and be
    a bit more conscious in our choices.</div>
